## People Picker
This project was created for the Travelers Engineering Development Program (EDP) as a way for instructors to interactively work with students.

# About the Project
This website allows you to pick a random person from the list of the students in this cohort. For privacy, information about these students are fabricated, but students were encouraged to contribute their own photos for the project.

# Learning Goals
For this project, students learned how to:
- Create Pull Requests on GitHub
- Create forks for a public GitHub repository
- Follow a GitHub open-source workflow to contribute to the project
- Respond to issues posted by instructors to improve the project

# How to Run
Clone the code from this repository. Ensure you have NPM and mongodb installed. Run the following in the root of the project:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run start
```

In a separate terminal starting in the root directory, run:
```bash
cd react-client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Note that `npm install` is only necessary the first time as it initializes dependencies.
